# Neon :: WS Companion :: Version 1.0.0.1
## Project
WS Companion provides Windsor Secondary Students with essential information regarding class timetables, teacher contact information, and important sites and blogs maintained by SD44 staff. This application allows students to better organize their school schedule with an up-to-date view of the day’s block rotation. It also gives students a mobile-friendly method of contacting teachers through their email, or visiting their website. WS Companion is in no way maintained by the North Vancouver School District or Windsor Secondary.


Neon is the project codename for WS Companion. More information on WS Companion can be found at [the app's download page](https://www.codeandconfusion.com/wscompanion). 
## Development

* Various performance enhancements
### Updates
A development blog can be found [here](https://www.codeandconfusion.tumblr.com/). 
### Production vs Development
Currently, all JavaScript is minified manually. Future versions will address this issue, but for now a developer will have to specify which code they want to compile at build time. In index.html, around line 120, instructions on how to this are provided. Obviously, any code written will not be automaticaly minified, and it's up to the developer to do that. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.
